SnakeSprint is a classic snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body.

## Getting Started

To play SnakeSprint, simply run the Python script `SnakeSprint.py`. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake: Up, Down, Left, and Right.

```
python SnakeSprint.py
```

## Gameplay

- The snake starts with a length of 1 segment.
- Eating food increases the snake's length by 1 segment.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
- Try to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as you can without crashing.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls.
- Dynamic scoring system.
- Adjustable speed for increased challenge.

## Dependencies

SnakeSprint requires Python 3.x and the Turtle module, which is included in the standard library.
